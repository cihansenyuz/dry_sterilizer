# dry_sterilizer
MCU controlled dry sterilizer to perform programmable thermal cycles between room temp and target temp. The project provides new configurable parameters; on-time at target temp, off-time at room temp.

HAL library is used.

Instructions to begin thermal cycles:
1- Reinstall the build in case of new on-time and/or off-time parameters.
2- Turn on the dry sterilizer.
3- Set the target temperature.
4- Set no delay and no countdown.
