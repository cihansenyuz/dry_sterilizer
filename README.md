# dry_sterilizer
MCU controlled dry sterilizer to perform programmable thermal cycles between room temp and target temp. The project provides new configurable parameters; on-time at target temp, off-time at room temp which lacks on the original dry sterilizer device.

My own libraries are used in the project.

- User application steps are described in a flow chart in the "user_flow_chart.pdf" file. Please see how to get the system ready for a new test.
- The algorithm runs on the MCU to perform a complete test is described in the "algorithm_flow_chart.pdf" file.
- Hardware modification done to the dry sterilizer equipment and designed open cell load is in the "Dry_Sterilizer_HW_Application.pdf" file. May be found schematics and PCB layout
